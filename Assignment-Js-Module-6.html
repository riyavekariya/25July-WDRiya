            <p>Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport. <br>
            Bootstrap comes with three different containers. <br>
            .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint. <br>
            .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint. <br>
            .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints. <br>
            </p>
            &nbsp;
