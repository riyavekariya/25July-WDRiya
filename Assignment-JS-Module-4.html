            <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that executes on the browser. It turns static HTML web pages into interactive web pages by updating content, validating form data, controlling multimedia, animate images, and almost everything else on the web pages. JavaScript is the third most important web technology after HTML and CSS. JavaScript can be used to create web and mobile applications, build web servers, create games, etc. JavaScript can be used in
            various activities like data validation, displaying popup messages, handling events of HTML elements, modifying CSS, etc. Nowadays,JavaScript can execute not only on browsers but also on the server or any device with a JavaScript Engine. JavaScript is a case-sensitive scripting language. JavaScript ignores multiple spaces and tabs.</p>
